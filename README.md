```bash
STOREFRONT_CI_OPERATOR_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxx
```

```bash
STOREFRONT_CI_NETLIFY_GITHUB_INSTALATION_ID=xxxxxxxxxx
```
> It is the installation ID of the netlify application on github.
As we did not find an easy way to obtain this ID, we created a test repository and deployed it manually on the netlify website. After doing this, consume `https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/sites` using the netlify token, so that the sites created and the github installation number are returned via `instalation_id`

```bash
STOREFRONT_CI_NETLIFY_BRANCH=dist
```
> It's the brach to Netlify listening your commits to make a deploy. `dist` it's default value

```bash
STOREFRONT_CI_NETLIFY_PROVIDER=github
```
> It's the provider to Netlify. `github` it's default value.
> In this moment, storefront-ci works only with github repositorys
